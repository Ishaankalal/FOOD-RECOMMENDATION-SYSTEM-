# FOOD-RECOMMENDATION-SYSTEM-


The objective of this code is to create a Food Recommendation System that suggests
suitable foods based on a userâ€™s health conditions, dietary preferences, nutrient
deficiencies, and health goals. The system consolidates and cleans data, categorizes foods
as vegetarian or non-vegetarian, and applies custom filtering criteria for specific diseases,
nutrient needs, and goals like muscle gain or weight loss. It then displays
recommendations and visualizations of nutrient levels in suggested foods.
